# Discordbot
Discord MathBot repository so you too can have MathBot (MathBot doesn't do math for you like a calculator and send it to a discord server, it generates a random math problem and sends it to the channel for people to do)


This bot requires you to put in the token and the channel id you want to have it send to.This bot is kind of a DIY to set up so to make your bot and get its token use https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/ to find the token and https://discord.com/developers/applications to make the bot in your server. To get the channel id refer to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akturol-8o4 then once your in dev mode right click the channel you want and copy channel ID should appear which you click to put in the script.


⚠THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO RUN THE SCRIPT⚠
Remember to fill out 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' and 'TARGET_CHANNEL_ID' with the channel id and bot token and remember to download python then open a new command prompt and do pip install discord because the discord module is VERY important to make this script run also pip install nextcord its important too. to get your guild id right click your server icon on the sidebar and click copy server id thats also important to run the script
